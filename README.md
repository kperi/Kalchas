# Kalchas : A greek polytonic OCR library  


Kalchas is a greek polytonic OCR library impemented in pytorch. 

This inital release is largely based on the work of Simistira et. al [Recognition of historical Greek polytonic scripts using LSTM networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7333865/), 
where the LSTM architecture has been replaced by the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) impemented in [crnn-pytorch](https://github.com/GitYCC/crnn-pytorch) . 

 




### Installation 

TODO


### Limitations 

This initial release only support OCR in segmented horizontal lines. Page layout analysis and end-to-end recognition is not supported in this version.

For basic segmentation the Kraken OCR library can be used. For image deskewing, also refer to the [wand-py](https://docs.wand-py.org/) (ImageMagick  bindings) library 



###  Example usage: 


 
![Test image](./images/010000.bin.png "Test image")

```python

import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

from kalchas.ocr import list_available_models, load_ocr_model


models = list_available_models() # get all available models 


model = load_ocr_model('model1') 


# load image and binarize it using the [kraken](https://kraken.re/main/index.html).ocr libray
image_path = "images/010000.bin.png" 
image  = Image.open(image_path).convert('L')
 

text = model.ocr([image]) #  ['ἡμέραν ἐς τὸ συγκείμενον. τρίτος δέ ποτε ἐν']

```
